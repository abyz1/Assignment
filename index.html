          <p>
            When talking about chicken recipes , its hard to deny that thereis 
            one dish in particular that stands high above the rest,casting its
            crispy shadow on the lesser foods over which it rules.That dish,of
            course ,is fried chicken . Many people shy away from fried chicken
            because of health concerns.If this describes you,we have some good
            news. While we will admit that fried chicken should definitely not
            be a daily indulgence,most people tend to overestimate its calorie
            count.Gram for gram,fried chicken is only slightly higher than beef
            in both fat and  calories and its still higher in protein  and most 
            vitamins and minerals.

        <h2>3. Ice-Cream</h2>
        <p>
            Ice cream is a frozen dessert, typically made from milk or cream and
            flavored with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and spice, 
            such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches.
            It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen
            together. Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. 
            The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to
            incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from 
            forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very 
            low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as
            its temperature increases.
